# BO-LANG (Bo Programming Language)

> BoLang is a programming language built in Go. It's a simple language designed for learning purposes.

This project is inspired by the book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball. The goal is to build a simple programming language that can be used to learn about programming language design and implementation. The language is called BoLang, named after my cat Bo. BoLang is a simple language that supports arithmetic operations, variables, functions, and control structures. The language is interpreted and implemented in Go. The interpreter is a work in progress and new features will be added over time.

## Features

- [x] Arithmetic operations
- [x] Variables
- [x] Functions
- [x] Control structures (if, else, for, forever)
- [x] Comments
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Coming soon...
